						<p>Raise your hand if you already have made a code contribution to Node.js core.</p>
						<p>Later on, if things settle down a bit, you can talk to a mentor about your interests and skills and what you want to do next in core.</p>
						<p>Until then, there's this link that will help you find stuff to work on. Open it up right now!</p>

						<p>Who got the email yesterday, did all the steps, and has tests working?</p>
						<p>Mentors, go and confirm a successful "make test" and then we'll get them tasks!</a>
						<p>Who cloned the repository but had trouble with later steps?</p>
						<p>Mentors, help those people!</p>
						<p>Who had trouble cloning the repo?</p>
						<p>Try this web torrent link.</p>
						<p>You probably want to get it from the slide deck rather than try to type it.</p>
						<p>If that fails, we have a USB drives.</p>
						<p>Thanks to Bryan for setting up the torrent link and the USB drives!</p>
						<p>And who either didn't get the email or ignored it entirely? For you people...</p>

						<p>Once you've followed the instructions here, raise your hand. A mentor will confirm your make test or vcbuild test results and then get you a task.</p>
						<p>Everyone gets one first time task. If you want a second contribution, ask for that specifically. You'll get something do-able but a bit more challenging.</p>
